Quick and Dirty Install Instructions:

1. First, ensure that you have installed Eclipse.
   
2. Download Quantum.  Currently, there are two versions of the Quantum binary.
   One works with Eclipse 2.x, and the other works with Eclipse 3.0.  Select
   the version that suits your environment.

3. Unzip quantum into the parent directory of eclipse [e.g. C:\eclipse]. The 
   zip file has the relative path eclipse/plugins/com.quantum.Quantum_2.4.4 
   So if you have called the eclipse directory by any other name you should 
   unzip into a temporary directory, take the com.quantum.Quantum_2.4.4 directory,
   and copy it into your plugins directory.
   
4. Launch eclipse. 
   
5. Open the Quantum DB Perspective 
   [Go to Windows -> Open Perspective -> Other and select Quantum DB Perspective]
   
        If you don't see the QuantumDB Perspective in the list, you may
        have a FAT file system.  Follow instructions in the Eclipse readme
        file found in (for example): $ECLIPSE_HOME/readme/readme_eclipse.html
   
   
6. Right click any where on the Bookmark view and select "New Bookmark..."

7. If you need more instructions, check the documentation online documentation 
   in the sourceforge page (http://sourceforge.net/docman/?group_id=7746).



Other Notes:
   
-  If you update to Quantum 2.4.4 from significantly earlier versions, you may get 
   warnings about not being able to restore some views.  Close your Quantum perspective 
   and re-open it.
